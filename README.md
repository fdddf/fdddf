# Hi, I'm Bright Wang

**Cloud / Golang / Kubernetes / DevOps Engineer**

I build high‑performance cloud‑native systems, developer tools, and distributed infrastructure. My work focuses on:

- **Golang** – backend engineering, CLI tools, cloud infrastructure automation
- **Cloud Engineering** – Google Cloud, container platforms, distributed systems
- **Kubernetes & DevOps** – controllers/operators, CI/CD, IaC, platform engineering
- **iOS & Tooling** – internal tools, automation, developer productivity

I enjoy designing reliable systems, creating developer tooling, and contributing to the open‑source ecosystem.
